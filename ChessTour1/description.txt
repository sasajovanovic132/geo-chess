This web application is dediceted to chess.
The purpose is to help user find Chess Clubs and Tournaments depending 
on user's location. User can look for Tournaments and Clubs that can be shown
listed by distance, date of the tournament or tournament prize 
and shown on map.

    - Data about Chess Clubs and Tournaments is stored in separated JSON files:
        clubs.json
        tournaments.json
      I used real data that I searched about clubs and tournaments
      mostly in Philadelphia and surroundings. Since most of scheduled tournaments
      that are scheduled for 2020 and 2021 are either canceled or moved to online format, 
      i used data mostly from 2019, projecting them for 2021.
      Anyway, this is only testing data and real data
      can easily be inserted once it becomes available.
      
    
    - Two custom Classes: ChessClub and ChessTournament are created to store
      data that will be fetched from JSON.
      Both have similar properties such are name, address,
      latitute, longitude, web page,
      and few that are different such is date that tournament has and Club doesnt, 
      or prize and tournament fee. 
      Both Classes have regular methods to set local properties and
      main method to locate users position using navigator API
      and calculate distance using Haversain formula, local properties lat and lon
      and users position coords(lat and lon).
      Tournament class also has a method to calculate time difference between 
      begining of the tournament and current date.


    When the page loads main function is called. Main function is located in index.mjs.
    In main function following 5 functions are called:

        - Function showMap() is button event function 
             uses Lefleat API to display map with user location using navigator API.

        - Functions addClub() and addTournament() are also button event functions
            that are used to create html form elements used for user's input 
            to capture data about Clubs and Tournaments that user wants to add to the main list
            of Clubs and Tournaments. 
            Both functions use Local Storage to set and save data. This two functions
            are kept in separated files: addClub.mjs and addTournaments.mjs.

        - Functions fetchClubs1() and fetchTournaments() are immidiately called from main
            when page loads. Both Functions use fetch() API to fetch Chess Club 
            and Chess Tournaments JSON data from local folder.

            - in both fetchClub() and fetchTournament()
            first then() method is used to transfer json array to object array of clubs
            and tournaments using map() Array Method. It also adds saved data from Local Storage and
            returns unified Array of Objects that combines fetched data and data from Local Storage.

            - in second then() method in fetchTournament() 3 functions are called:
              - sortTourByDate()
              - sortTourByDistance()
              - sortTourByPrize
              They are kept in separeted files:sortTourByDate.mjs,sortTourByDistance.mjs,sortTourByPrize
                Each of these functions are button events displayed on the screen when page loads
                that take chessTournament array returned from first then()
                  and use sort() Array method to sort Array by property values of ChessTournament instancies:
                  date, distance and prize and call uploadDom() function located in buttonUploadDom.mjs to display
                  the list of 10 sorted button elements.Also new button 'next' is attached
                  that is used to display next page of the list (10 - 20).
                  Each button represents an event for the 
                  function loadDOM() that is kept in separated file loadDOM.mjs.
                    - loadDOM uploads the box on the page displaying info for every ChessTournament instancies
                     by using DOM methods and uses google map methods to set and display the location of every instance on
                     the google map.
                     

           - in second then() method in fetchClubs1()
            function mainChessClubs() is called. This function is located in chessClubs.mjs file.
              - mainChessClubs() takes array chessClubs as argument returned from first then and 
              uses sort() Array method to sort array by distance, property of ChessClub instance
              and displays list of 10 button elements representing instancies of ChessClub class.
              It also adds next button that is used to display list from 10 to 20.
              Each button is event listener for function loadClubDOM(),located in loadClubDOM.mjs file.
                  This function uploads the box on the page displaying info for every ChessClub instancies
                  by using DOM methods. 

Note:
 I have limited user to add up to 3 clubs or tournaments. I have initially set json files for 17 clubs
and 17 tournaments. So total can be max 20 displayed in two different pages in the box on the screen for both,
Chess Clubs and Chess Tournaments. If the user adds forth club or tournament, the last one will replace the 
first one that was added.
This can easily be changed to be exteneded but at this point i didn't think that it was neccessery to have more
than 20 Clubs and 20 Tournaments.
I used both Google Map API  and Lefleat API. Lefleat map is used to display user's location. Google map is used
to display locations of clubs and tournaments. Google map Key was added manualy in index.html.
